a simple todo list app 

## Purpose and Scope
The purpose of this originally is a simple JS to do list app for Server Side Programming class. It uses plain HTML5, CSS3, and VanillaJS with some help from the library jQuery. 

## First Completed Push
The first commit was to make sure that the default entries are on the page and be able to add more elements to the DOM using JS. 

## Second Completed Push and Branch 
This push is to add the delete feature and slighly tweak the CSS styles 

## Facing Problems 
When I first started to code the solution, I was trying to save the entries in the local memory but had some trouble on retrieval. So instead, the entries do not persist on refresh of the page.

## Final Result 
This was a great exercise to use plain JS to manipulate the DOM and deal with real world apps and problems of scale.

## Future Integration?
To come back and add a database (MongoDB) and a backend to perform CRUD operations.
